# Citizens

### **Not Yet Released On Plugin Hub**

This plugin adds a lot of NPCs (citizens) around runescape to make the world feel more alive.

# Guidelines

1. Citizens should 'fit in' with runescape, and look natural for the area that they're in.
2. Currently, we do not add "fake players" (e.g. like "CowSlayer37" wearing dharoks armor).
3. Citizens should not interfere with normal npcs/objects or gameplay.
4. Citizens should be reasonably thought out and unique; don't just add a bunch quickly in random places with no
   thought.

# Thanks

- [Diabolickal](https://github.com/Diabolickal) for significant code contributions, including the ingame editor.
- Originally forked from https://github.com/skeldoor/duck-duck-goose, which helped in getting me started. Much of
  their code (particularly for movement) remains.
- [RuneMonk EntityViewer](https://runemonk.com/tools/entityviewer/?type=item&id=6169#/?type=npc&id=2205&anim=6966&rotation=-1.25_0.21_0&translation=0_-100_-185)
  is very useful for finding models and animations.
